                    <h2>Retail Question 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        Based on the data provided in assignment, 8451_The_Complete_Journey_2_Sample.zip,
                        retail business seem to have been affected by Covid-19 pandemic. 
                        We predicted that sales would decrease in 2020 in comparison with 2019 due to high unemployment 
                        rate in the US and across the globe. 
                        While exploring the data, the result we found was that net sales drastically 
                        decreased in 2020 compare to 2019. Also due to the lockdown in the US, there were several 
                        commodities that were not needed for daily use, which mean the sales would definitely be 
                        impacted. With the pandemic ending, we expect that more people would go out and the sales of 
                        alcohol will increase.

                    <p>
                        Among several categories provided in the dataset such as family size, income, 
                        presence of children, etc., we specifically used SQL queries on commodities such as 
                        alcohol and auto, and on the household size with income range to test our prediction. 
                        Due to unemployment, we believe that sales of alcohol decreased in 2020 compare to 2019. 
                        In addition, due to work from home set up with most companies in the US, the need for auto 
                        equipment decreased implying decreased sales in that commodity as well. We also did queries 
                        on net sales in all commodities in 2019 and 2020 and found similar result, which is 
                        decreased in the total sales in 2020. We did query on the alcohol sales by the number of 
                        child presence and income range by year, and found that the income range between 50K-74K 
                        spent more on alcohol in 2019/2020 compared to other income ranges in 2019/2020, and alcohol 
                        sales of household with 1 child is higher that the alcohol sales of household with more than 
                        1 child in both years. Overall natural factor â€“ Covid-19 seem to have affected customer 
                        engagement in retail industry.
